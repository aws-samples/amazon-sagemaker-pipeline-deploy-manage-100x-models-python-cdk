The inference data has already undergone preprocessing for consumption by the endpoint. 
In a production environment, it is advisable to consider employing an inference pipeline 
to preprocess input data in a manner consistent with the preprocessing applied during model training. 
This ensures alignment between the data used for training and the data fed into the model during production.
